# WebSystem I²oT (Inventory IoT)

This repository holds a prototype of the project I²oT, an inventory system that aims to monitor and track the patrimonial gods of an institution. The web system works like a social media where the smart objects are your friends and you can see information about them. We also created an Ontology called I²oTology, which is an extension of the [IoT-Lite](https://www.w3.org/Submission/iot-lite/), a light ontology for IoT devices.
